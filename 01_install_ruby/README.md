# Install Ruby 

In this tutorial I will show you how to install Ruby in your machine.

## Installation in Ubuntu 16.04

I have chosen Ubuntu 16.04 because is a popular OS for developers and also for deployments. If you do not have this OS or you just want to play, you can use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) with this [Vagrantfile](Vagrantfile) as a sandbox to learn. 

Even though there are many ways to install Ruby in Ubuntu, I prefer using the [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) Ruby version manager tool. We will install this tool and then a version of a Ruby interpreter to be able to program in this language.

### 1. Install Ubuntu dependences
